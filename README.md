Hi Luke 

## About this website
The goal is to demo Google's "login with Google" feature, with the following caveats: 
* I will spend exactly 0 dollars on this project
* Logging in with google will have an effect on what content you can see, such that
* My brother will see a version of a website he made. 

To this end, I'm using vercel serverless functions to handle the google login, and I'm using a google sheet as a database. Probably.

## Retrigger build action, since the redirect url hasn't changed to pastebin
